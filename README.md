# ✈️ Airline Reservation System (Django)

The **Airline Reservation System** is a full-stack web application built with the Django framework and PostgreSQL(via Docker and Flyway migrations).It allows users to search, book, and cancel flight tickets, while administrators can manage flights and monitor all reservations through the Django Admin Panel.

## 📦 Technologies Used
- 🐍 Python (Django Framework)
- 🐘 PostgreSQL — primary database
- 🚀 Flyway — version-controlled database migrations
- 🐳 Docker & Docker Compose — containerized environment
- 💻 HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- 🎨 Bootstrap — frontend styling

## 🗄️ Database Technology

This project uses **PostgreSQL** as the primary database engine, managed through Flyway migrations for schema version control.
All database tables and structures are defined in SQL migration files stored under:
```bash
flyway/sql/
```
When the containers start, Flyway automatically applies any new migrations to keep the database schema up to date.


**Default configuration (docker-compose.yml):**
- Database: airline_db
- User: airline_user
- Password: airline_pass
- Port: 5432

This setup ensures consistent database state across all environments — development, testing, and production.
